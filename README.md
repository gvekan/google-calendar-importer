# google-calendar-importer
Import events from a calendar to a google calendar you own.  
For now you can onlly import from a GC to a GC so if the 
calendar you want to import is not a GC you have to subcribe 
to the ics on GC before importing it to a GC you own.  
Functions to import directly from ics is under development.
